The use of machine learning to analyze data obtained through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) provides eye-opening insights into cellular biology. Applications of this type of data analysis range from understanding tumor heterogeneity (with potential for creating life-saving, patient-specific treatment) to studying stochastic gene expression. In my research, I analyze the performance of a series of supervised learning models on three sets of scRNAseq data. Each modelâ€™s goal is to predict cell type based on expression levels of different genes within each cell. By training these models on our data I discover correlations between expression levels of specific genes and their cellular phenotypes. Cell-type classification is highly relevant in areas within the medical industry. For example, classifying healthy versus cancerous cells can be used in detecting an early onset of cancer or detecting how far a tumor has spread. Additionally, my research is highly relevant for educational purposes. It provides students in both biology and computer science a real-world application of the central dogma of molecular biology and fundamentals of machine learning (ie. dimensionality reduction, cross-validation, grid searching, supervised learning models, confusion matrices, etc.). In the end, I discovered which supervised learning methods (including their specific hyperparameters), performed the best for differentiating cell types based on gene expression on each dataset. My models and analysis have implications for establishing a framework for future research in cell-type classification.
