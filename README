The use of machine learning to analyze data obtained through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) provides eye-opening insight into cellular biology. Applications of this type of data analysis range from understanding tumor heterogeneity (with potential in creating life-saving, patient-specific, treatment) to studying stochastic gene expression. In our research, we analyze the performance of a series of supervised learning models on three sets of scRNAseq data. Each modelâ€™s goal is to predict cell type based on different levels of gene expression within each cell. By training these models on our data we discover correlations between specific genes and their phenotypic characteristics. Cell-type classification is highly relevant in the areas within the medical industry. For example, cell-type classification can be used in detecting an early onset of cancer or detecting how far a tumor has spread. Additionally, our research is highly relevant for educational purposes. It provides students in both biology and computer science a real-world application of the central dogma of molecular biology and fundamentals of machine learning (ie. dimensionality reduction, cross-validation, grid searching, supervised learning models, confusion matrices, etc.). In the end, we discovered which unsupervised learning methods (including their specific hyperparameters), performed the best for differentiating cell types based on gene expression on each dataset. Our models and analysis of each model have implications for establishing a framework for future research in cell-type classification.
